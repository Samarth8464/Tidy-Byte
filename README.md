# Tidy-Byte
In this project, i have tried to solve a very common yet ignored problem that occurs to all sorts of users that is having a very messed up folder with every kind of file , unarranged and creates issues when we are looking for specific files. This project will help to clean up or arrange files in a specific sub-file based on extensions ,time,etc.
